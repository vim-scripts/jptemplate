You will find a lot of documentation and some demo videos on http://lunar-linux.org/~jannis/jptemplate/.

You can also download the script and its documentation directly from my git repository on http://git.gezeiten.org/?p=jptemplate.git.

Please send bugs and feature requests to the email address which you will find on my profile page. I especially appreciate ideas for new special variables!
